# MNIST
Every data scientist eventually tackles MNIST. Here's my attempts.

1. (0.75171) LeNet set to minimize cross-entropy. Trained for 100 epochs.
2. (0.98614) AlexNet with the same parameters.
3. (Running) Modified GoogleNet with Batch Normalization instead of LRN, and an average pooling layer removed.
